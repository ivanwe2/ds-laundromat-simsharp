# Discrete Simulation of a Laundry Service

    This repository contains the source code and documentation for the
    Discrete Simulation of a Laundry Homework in course Discrete Simulation '25.

    Created using .NET 8 MVC app utilizing the python port of SimPy -> SimSharp 
    with a tad more complicated UI that allows the user to tweak the parameters 
    of the simulation. The Frontend takes advantage of AJAX requests for data transfer and
    ChartsJs for seamless chart visualization.

    ?Deployed on a public cloud provider Render.
